Two projects done using the Arduino microcontroller<br>

1. A simulation on Proteus for a <b>health monitoring system</b>. <br>
  * It monitors <i>heart rate</i>, <i>blood presssure</i> and <i>temperature</i>. <br>
  * It displays the state of health of the patient using an LCD and LEDs <br>
  * Contancts a doctor (via text) when the health is worrisome <br>

2. A physical implementation of a <b>flood detection and aversion system</b>. <br>
  * It monitors the <i>level of water in an area</i>, the <i>soil moisture content</i> and the <i>amount of rain</i>. <br>
  * The chance of flooding is displayed on an LCD and indicated using an LED.<br>
  * When flooding is imminent, a gating system is activated to drain water. <br>
